# Analysis on Impact of Age on Customer Buying Habits using Two-Sample Inference Testing

📊 This project focuses on analyzing the impact of age on customer buying habits using two-sample inference testing. By leveraging an open-source dataset obtained from Kaggle, we examine the demographics of customers who clicked on a specific online advertisement. The statistical analysis aims to provide insights and recommendations to help businesses compete effectively in the market and drive profit.

## Dataset Information

📋 The dataset used in this analysis contains the following demographics about customers who clicked the advertisement online:

- `User ID`: Unique identification for the consumer
- `Age`: Customer age in years
- `Estimated Salary`: Average income of the consumer
- `Gender`: Whether the consumer is male or female
- `Purchased`: 0 or 1 indicating whether the customer purchased the product

## Objectives

🎯 The objectives of this project are:

1. Determine the impact of age on purchase behavior.
2. Analyze whether the mean age of customers who purchased the product is greater than those who have not purchased it.
3. Identify the age group that benefits the most from the product.

## Analysis

🔍 The analysis employs two-sample inference testing to compare the mean age of customers who purchased the product with those who did not. The assumptions of independence and normality are verified, and a pooled t-test is performed using the dataset. The results support the conclusions drawn from the statistical analysis.

## Conclusion

📝 Based on the analysis and statistical results, the following conclusions can be made:

- Age significantly impacts purchase behavior.
- The mean age of customers who purchased the product is greater than those who have not purchased it.
- The age group between 45 and 50 benefits the most from the product.

## Recommendations

🚀 Recommendations for business strategy and marketing efforts based on the analysis:

- Focus advertising efforts on mature individuals, particularly those around 45 years old.
- Consider developing specific marketing strategies to target the 45-50 age range.
- Explore product modifications or new product lines to appeal to the 35-40 age group.

## Additional Analysis and Visualizations

📊 Further analysis can be performed using various plots and visualizations to gain deeper insights into the relationship between customer age and buying behavior. The provided dataset can be used to create histograms, mosaic plots, and more, enabling a comprehensive understanding of the data.
